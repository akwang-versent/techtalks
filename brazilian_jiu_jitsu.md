# Brazilian Jiu Jitsu

### Background
- It was developed in 1925 by the Gracie family in Brazil after being taught Japanese judoka from a master ground fighter Mitsuyo Maeda<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsuyo_Maeda)</sup>.
- Mitsuyo Maeda fought many no holds barred matches with many European fighters in the early 1900s, spreading the advantages of Judo.
- Gracie Jiu Jitsu<sup>[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu)</sup> was formed after Helio Gracie, the youngest and weakest of his brothers, developed the martial art around the idea that a smaller weaker person could defend themselves against a bigger, stronger and heavier opponent by using leverage and weight distribution<sup>[[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQna-XSdTsA)</sup>. 


## What drew me to martial arts?
- Growing up my dad was a fan of Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris and Steven Segal
- Bruce Lee was such an icon growing up, and in the early 90s, martial arts, actions films and nunchucks were a large part of the zeitgeist of the male populus.

### Why did I want to do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu?
- I had run into a lot more aggresive types in the surf line up than usual, and they left me feeling vulnerable.
- I started training as a way to build up stamina, strength and a defense mechanism should I run into any unfortunate circumstances.
- So why BJJ and not something else?
    - It seems like the most effective martial art, if you were engaged with confrontation that you could not remove yourself from.
    - The only other option if you can't create distance between you and your attacker, is that you close that distance. In that situation, it is much better to have some knowledge of close quarter combat/grappling than nothing before.
    - If you are striking, then to disarm your opponent, you either have to have very good knowledge of power, distance control/position and agility along with striking technique to execute something. But, if you know how to twist someone's limbs, it will eventually break or they will be incapacitated by the pain it produces on the ligaments.

### Where are the places to train?
- There's a lot of places to train in Sydney<sup>[[4]](https://www.bosshunting.com.au/sport/best-brazilian-jiu-jitsu-bjj-gyms-sydney/)</sup>:

### Learning Curve
- Remember that if you think you're big and tough, there is always going to be someone bigger and/or touger than you.
- Ego in the gym is going to make you a good candidate for an hour of getting lessons on humility, by way of getting choked out a lot by higher belts.
- A black belt is a white belt who never quit.
- If you get disheartened by getting constantly choked and beat down and adopt a victim's mentality or create excuses, it will stifle your progression. A mentality that serves you is to have the mindset that every time you are submitted, it's an opportunity to learn where you can improve.
- Just because you have a higher rank than someone you're rolling with, it doesn't mean that you will automatically tap them.
- Never underestimate your opponent, as Bruce Lee once said "Never take your eyes off your opponent, even when you bow".
